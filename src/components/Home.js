        Just make little strokes like that. Let's make some happy little clouds
        in our world. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your
        world. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town
        and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much
        to get you addicted. All you have to learn here is how to have fun.
        Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these
        happy things? It's so important to do something every day that will make
        you happy. Let's build an almighty mountain. This is your world,
        whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. If you don't like
        it - change it. It's your world. There he comes. Anyone can paint. You
        have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Let's make a nice
        big leafy tree. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you
        start, they sort of just make themselves. We don't make mistakes we just
        have happy little accidents. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have
        to scare them out. This is where you take out all your hostilities and
        frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that
        so. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Let's put
        some happy little bushes on the other side now. We'll throw some happy
        little limbs on this tree. Be brave. Maybe we got a few little happy
        bushes here, just covered with snow. We don't have to be concerned about
        it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Trees grow however makes
        them happy. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things.
        But sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics. Very easy to
        work these to death. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. I was
        blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're
        doing these little delicate things. We'll put a happy little bush here.
        That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. I
        really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run
        you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. Poor old
        tree. And maybe a little bush lives there. Here we're limited by the
        time we have. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel
        good when you paint.
